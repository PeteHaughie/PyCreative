# PyCreative

PyCreative is a batteries-included creative-coding framework that makes it trivial to build visual, audio, and interactive projects in Python while staying lightweight and extensible. It uses PyGame for low-level drawing, input, and window/context management, but provides higher-level conveniences: a component-driven app loop, scene & state management, easy shader support, multimedia I/O, asset management, utilities for math & noise, tight integration for live-coding, and idiomatic Python APIs inspired by Processing and openFrameworks.

A batteries-included creative coding framework for Python, inspired by Processing/openFrameworks, built atop PyGame.

## Features
- Modular architecture for easy extension
- 2D/3D graphics, OpenGL, audio, video, MIDI, user input
- Asset management, hot-reload, and live-coding support
- Simple, discoverable, and chainable APIs

## Quickstart
```bash
pycreative examples/hello_sketch.py
```
