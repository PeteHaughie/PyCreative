# PyCreative
PyCreative is a batteries-included creative-coding framework that makes it trivial to build visual, audio, and interactive projects in Python while staying lightweight and extensible. It uses PyGame for low-level drawing, input, and window/context management, but provides higher-level conveniences: a component-driven app loop, scene & state management, easy shader support, multimedia I/O, asset management, utilities for math & noise, tight integration for live-coding, and idiomatic Python APIs inspired by Processing and openFrameworks.
