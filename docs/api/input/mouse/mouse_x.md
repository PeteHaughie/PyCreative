# mouse_x

## Description

The system variable `mouse_x` always contains the current horizontal coordinate of the mouse.

Note that PyCreative can only track the mouse position when the pointer is over the current window. The default value of `mouse_x` is 0, so 0 will be returned until the mouse moves in front of the sketch window. (This typically happens when a sketch is first run.) Once the mouse moves away from the window, `mouse_x` will continue to report its most recent position.

## Example

```py
def draw(self):
    self.background(204)
    self.line(self.mouse_x, 20, self.mouse_x, 80)
```

## Syntax

.mouse_x

## Return

int
