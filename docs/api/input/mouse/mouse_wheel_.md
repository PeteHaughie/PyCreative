# mouse_wheel()

## Description

The code within the `mouse_wheel()` event function is run when the mouse wheel is moved. (Some mice don't have wheels and this function is only applicable with mice that have a wheel.) The `get_count()` function used within `mouse_wheel()` returns positive values when the mouse wheel is rotated down (toward the user), and negative values for the other direction (up or away from the user). On OS X with "natural" scrolling enabled, the values are opposite.

Mouse and keyboard events only work when a program has `draw()`. Without `draw()`, the code is only run once and then stops listening for events.

## Example

```py
def setup(self):
    self.size(100, 100)

def draw(self):
    pass

def mouse_wheel(self, event):
    e = event.get_count()
    print(e)
```

## Syntax

.mouse_wheel(event)

## Parameters

| Input | Description |
