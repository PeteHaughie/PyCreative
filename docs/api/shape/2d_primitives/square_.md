# square()

## Description

Draws a square to the screen. A square is a four-sided shape with every angle at ninety degrees and each side is the same length. By default, the first two parameters set the location of the upper-left corner, the third sets the width and height. The way these parameters are interpreted, however, may be changed with the `rect_mode()` function.

## Examples

```py
self.square(120, 100, 220)
```

## Syntax

square(x, y, extent)

## Parameters

|--------|-------------|
| x	(float) | x-coordinate of the rectangle by default |
| y	(float) | y-coordinate of the rectangle by default |
| extent	(float) | width and height of the rectangle by default |
